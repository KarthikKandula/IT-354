        <p>ECMAScript is a scripting language specification designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich">Brendan Eich.</a> 
          ECMA International is an organization that creates standards for technologies. 
          ECMA-262 is a standard published by ECMA International that contains specifations for a general purpose scripting language.
          ECMAScript is the specification defined in ECMA-262 for creating a general purpose scripting language.
          JavaScript is one of the famous scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specifications. </p>
        <p class="pt-2"> Brandon Eich while working at NetScape created a scripting language in 1995 known as Mocha later named to LiveScript and then finally to JavaScript.
          In 1996 NetScape held meetings with ECMA International to standardize JavaScript.
          The first edition of ECMA-262 was adopted by the ECMA International in 1997.
          There are 10 editions of the language standard published since then, Version 10 released in June 2019 being the latest. </p>
        <p class="pt-2">Any scripting language following ECMAScript specifications generally has the following features</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><b>Structured:</b> Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, 
            quality, and development time of a computer program by making use of the top-down approach while 
            using control statements(if/then/else), repetition statements(while and for), block structures, and subroutines.</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Dynamic:</b> Dynamic programming is a programming paradigm used in high-level programming 
            languages which execute code at runtime. This may include adding new code by extending the program or extending objects and definitions. </p></li>
          <li><p><b>Functional:</b> Functional programming is a programming paradigm where most of the functionality is acheived through functions, expressions and declarations. </p></li>
          <li><p><b>Prototype-based:</b> Prototype-based programming is a programming paradigm where code is reused via a process of 
            reusing existing objects using generalized objects which can be cloned and extended. </p></li>
          <li><p><b>Weakly Typed:</b> ECMAScript JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are assigned implicitly based on the operation being performed.
            JavaScript's variables can be changed from one type to another with ease.
          </p></li>
          <li><p><b>Dynamic Typing:</b> ECMAScript JavaScript is dynamically typed which means a variable associates it's type with a value rather than an expression. </p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pt-2"> ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript to help boost multiple independent implementations. 
          ECMAScript languages are commonly used for client-side scripting but increasingly they are being used to write server side scripting and develop applications using Node.js. </p>
