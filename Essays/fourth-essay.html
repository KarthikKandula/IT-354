        <h1 class="text-center">Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture</h1>
        <p>Despite coming into light only a few years ago, microservices are an accelerating trend these days.
          Microservices approach offers tangible benefits including an increase in scalability, flexibility, agility 
          and other advantages. Tech leaders like Netflix, Google, Amazon have successfully switched from monolithic
          architecture to microservices architecture. </p>
        <p>On the other side, monolithic approach is the default model for creating a software application. 
          Its trend is going down because building a monolithic application poses a number of challenges like
          handling a huge code base, adopting a new technology, scaling, deployment, implementing new changes & others. </p>
        <h2>Monolithic Architecture</h2>
        <p> <b>Monolithic Architecture</b> is considered to be the traditional way of building applications. 
        A monolithic application is built as a single unit. Usually, software applications built using monolithic 
        Architecture comprises of a client-side user interface, a server side application and a database. </p>
        <h4>Advantages of Monolithic Architecture</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b>Easy to handle</b> - Because everything is included in one application, it is easier to handle.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Easier debugging and testing</b> - Since monolithic application is a single unit, running 
              end-to-end testing is much easier and faster.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Easy to deploy</b> - Another advantage with the simplicity of a monolithic app is its ease
            of deployment. You don't have to handle any deployments - just one file or directory. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Simple to develop</b> - Monolithic approach being the standard way of building applications, 
            any engineering team has the right knowledge and capabilities of developing a monolithic app. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b>Understanding & Scalability</b> - When a monolithic app scales up, it becomes too complicated
            to understand. Also, a complex code with one application is hard to manage. You cannot scale 
            components independently, only the whole application. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Making changes</b> - It is harder to implement changes in such a large application with 
              complex code, since code change affects the whole system. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>New Technology barriers</b> - It is highly problematic to apply a new technology because the entire
            application has to be rewritten. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Microservices Architecture</h2>
        <p>A <b>Microservices Architecture</b> breaks a monolithic application into a collection of smaller 
          independent units. These units carry out every application process as a seperate service. So each 
        individual service have their own logic & the database to perform the specific functions.</p>
        <p>Within the microservices architecture, the entire functionality is split into different modules
          which communicate with each other through defined methods called <b>APIs</b> (Application Programming Interfaces).
        </p>
        <h4>Advantages of Microservices Architecture</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b>Independent components</b> - All services can be deployed and updated independently, which
            adds to flexibility. It is much easier to add features to a microservices application than a 
            monolithic application. A bug in any of the services will not shut down the entire application but 
            has impact only on the particular service. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Easier Understanding & Better Scalability</b> - Because it is split into smaller & simpler components,
            a microservice application is easier to understand and manage. Another advantage of the microservices approach
            is that each element can be scaled independently.  </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Flexibility in choosing the technology</b> - Teams are not limited by the technology chosen fromt the start.
            They are free to apply various technologies and frameworks for each microservice. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Disdvantages of Microservices Architecture</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b>Extra complexity</b> - Since a microservices application is a distributed system, you have
            to choose and set up the connections between all the modules and databases. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>System distribution</b> - A microservices architecture is a complex system of multiple 
            modules and databases so all the connections have to be handled carefully. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Testing</b> - Because Microservices application is a collection of independently deployable
            components, this makes testing a microservices-based solution much harder. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
