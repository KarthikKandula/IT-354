        <h1 class="text-center">Common Usability Mistakes In Web Design</h1>
        <h3>1. Tiny Clickable Areas</h3>
        <p>Hyperlinks are made to be clicked, so it makes sense to have them clickable. One of the top most common usability mistakes 
          in web design is to have the hypeprlinks so small that it is difficult to click them. A small clickable area is a problem 
          because it is not user friendly and the user might be missing an important link. We want a larger clickable area especially
        on mobile screens because it is difficult to click on something without a mouse.</p>
        <h3>2. Pagination used for the Wrong Purpose</h3>
        <p>Pagination referes to splitting up content into several pages so that there is not a lot of content on one page. It is also
          helpful while loading pages because long pages take longer to load. Google does a really good job of splitting up search
          results into several pages such that 1 page only has 10 - 15 results (although most people don't ever visit page 2 of google, you
          can hide a dead body and nobody finds out).</p>
          <p>Some of the pages like blogs use pagination in an annoying way to increase their page count. They split up content that
            is supposed to be in the same page into several pages to increase their page count and inturn increase their ad-revenue. 
          This is one of my biggest pet-peeves on websites especially some news organizations and blogs. </p>
        <h3>3. No Way To Get In Touch</h3>
        <p>Some of the companies that provide services do not update their contact information or don't have their contact information
          on their website at all. Instead they have sections called FAQ(Frequently asked questions) or 'Submit your question'. Such kind
          of websites and companies don't give any chance to interact with the company. Some don't have an e-mail address or any king of 
          contact information at all. It feels like they don't want to talk to their customers at all. </p>
