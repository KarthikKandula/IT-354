        <p>This is a really good tutorial for beginners in web development. Probably a little advanced(for dead beginners) 
          but gives a good head start. The webpage that he created looked professional and easy.</p>
          <p> Few new things that I learnt</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p> Creating a new div by typing '.class-name' and press enter. This might be a really silly thing that 
                only I didn't know, but it's really useful and a great shortcut.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Holding <b> Shift + alt + up/down arrow</b> to copy the whole line either above or below that line depending
              on the key pressed. This might be a great way to create duplicates of elements and edit rather than selecting
              the whole thing then doing copy & paste. Few of the elements(tags) where this can be used are <b>p, ul, ol, li, a</b> etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Holding <b>Ctrl + alt + up/down arrow</b> to create multiple cursors and edit multiple lines at the 
                same time. This is not something that was in the video, I learnt this by researching when he 
                referenced that he forgot how to do that. Few of the scenarios where this can be used are adding or 
                removing classes or id's to multiple tags like <b>p, ul, ol, li, a</b> etc. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Few of the alignments he did with his header using <b>display: flex;</b> was kind of new to me. I tried doing
              it before in my website but I used a bootstrap class to do, due to which I really didn't know how it worked.
              Now that I know how to do it, I'll use my own styles to do my header.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>I was amazed how easy it was to do an animation. I've tried using animations before and felt that it was
                 complicated and didn't end up doing it. I'll learn more about animations and use it in my portfolio site. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Few things that I liked</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Changed stylization of the button really well. It was simple, fast and the button looked professional. 
                Usage of webkit was impressive. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Adding shadows to the picture was another thing that I liked about the tutorial. That makes pictures look
                more convincing. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Using gradient on heading was another thing that I liked as well as learnt new. I knew how to do a 
                gradient to the div but not to text. This is another useful resourse to makes websites look good</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>I liked how he used all the eclipse circles in the background using <b>position: absolute;</b>. They added
              a nice touch to the page. I also learned something new about how to use position: absolute; </p>
