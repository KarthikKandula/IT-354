        <h1 class="text-center">Key Principles Of Good Website Usability</h1>
        <h3>1. Availability and Accessibility</h3>
        <p>Availability is a basic yet central aspect of Usability. When people try to access your site and it's down it defeats the 
          whole purpose of having a website. Not only will the users be frustated but companies might also loose valuable customers. </p>
        <p>Some of the basics of Availability and Accessibility</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>It is important to always keep your website up and running. Invest in good hosting.</p></li>
          <li><p>Double check that there are no dead links on your site.</p></li>
          <li><p>Make sure that your site is responsive to different screens and sizes. It does not make sense to have a great desktop
            site while your mobile site sucks.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Clarity</h3>
        <p>The core of usability is Clarity. If you confuse or distract your users they might forget their main motive of coming to the
          website and return dissatisfied with no intention of coming back.  </p>
          <p>Clarity can be acheived through</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p><b>Simplicity:</b> Simple is the way to go. Focus on what's important. Don't distract your users, help them do what they want to do. </p></li>
            <li><p><b>Familiarity:</b> Make elements of website look like what people might expect. Don't try to re-invent the wheel.  </p></li>
            <li><p><b>Consistency:</b> Create a consistent experience across the site. Avoid design few pages excellently and few pages poorly. Consistency is important. </p></li>
          </ul>
        <h3>3. Learnability</h3>
        <p>Learnability is another important aspect of Usability. By now, most of the people are familiar with most of design concepts 
          on the web. Use these concepts consistently, so that you meet expectations of the users. If you want to use new concepts in
          your design, make sure that these concepts are simple, easily understandable and quickly learnable. Offer help to users by providing
          details about the new design</p>
        <h3>4. Credibility</h3>
        <p>Credibility is a crucial aspect of any website. Even if user's find the content they were looking for, if they don't trust you
          it's worthless. Make sure visitors know that you are a real company, have an 'About Us' page which describes the company.
        Content plays a crucial part for the trustworthiness of your site. Make sure you are honest and precise about your content. Format it
      and organize it well with no grammar or spelling mistakes. Show that you are the best at what you do. </p>
        <h3>5. Relevancy</h3>
        <p>Relevancy contributes a lot to good website quality. Content must be relevant to what we want to convey. It is essential to
          know your users and why they visit your website. Know your users well and put content that is really useful and relevant to your
        users. </p>
        <p>Good Usability is not attained overnight. It requires a lot of research and iterative approach of constant testing.</p>
