        <h1 class="text-center">Node & V8 engine </h1>
        <p>JavaScript was created in 1995 and has since been known to be the dominant language for web development. For much of its initial days 
          JavaScript was used mainly for client-side scripting inside <code> &lt;script&gt; </code> tags executing in web browsers. Due to this limitation,
        developers were often using different languages and frameworks between the front-end and backend aspects of a web application. </p>
        <h2 class="text-center"> Node </h2>
        <p>Node.js came into existence in 2009 when the original developers of JavaScript extended it from something you could only run in the browser to something 
          you could run on your machine as a standalone application.  </p>
        <p>Here's a formal definition for Node.js, per the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js website</a>: </p>
        <blockquote>Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. <br> <br> Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that 
          makes it lightweight and efficient. </blockquote>
        <p>Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can be used to 
        write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications. </p>
        <h4>Features of Node.js</h4>
        <p>Following are some of the important features that make Node.js the first choice of developers.</p>
        <h5>Asynchronous and Event Driven</h5>
        <p>All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data.</p>
        <h5>Very Fast</h5>
        <p>Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.</p>
        <h5>Single Threaded but Highly Scalable</h5>
        <p>Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much 
          larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.</p>
        <h5>No Buffering</h5>
        <p>Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.</p>
        <h5>License</h5>
        <p>Node.js is released under the MIT license.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center"> V8 Engine </h2>
        <p>A <b>JavaScript engine</b> is a program or an interpreter which executes JavaScript code. A JavaScript engine can be implemented as a standard
        interpreter, or just-in-time complier that compiles JavaScript to bytecode in some form. </p>
        <p>Here's a formal definition for V8, per the <a href="https://v8.dev/">V8 Official website</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others.
          <br> <br> V8 compiles and executes JavaScript source code, handles memory allocation for objects, and garbage collects objects it no longer needs. V8’s 
          stop-the-world, generational, accurate garbage collector is one of the keys to V8’s performance.
        </blockquote>
        <p>V8 was first designed to increase the performance of JavaScript execution inside web browsers. In order to obtain speed, V8 translates JavaScript
          code into more efficient machine code instead of using an interpreter. It complies JavaScript code into machine code at execution by implementing
        a <b>JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler</b> like most of the modern JavaScript engines. </p>
        <p>Both JavaScript and Node.js run on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine. This engine takes your JavaScript code and converts it into a faster 
          machine code. Machine code is low-level code which the computer can run without needing to first interpret it. </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-center">How Node.js uses V8 engine</h2>
        <p> Let's first understand how JavaScript is compiled and Run </p>
        <p> <b>JavaScript Program</b> (source code) &rarr; <b>Chrome V8 Engine </b> (complied) &rarr; <b>Machine Code</b> (bytecode) &rarr; Runs on CPU </p>
        <p>Different CPU architecture requires different machine code based on its architecture. So, the program needs to be converted into the machine code 
          the machine can understand. Javascript program is compiled and the bytecode (machine code) is optimized and finally, the machine code runs on the CPU. 
          All these operations are performed by the V8.</p>
        <p>Let's see where the JavaScript resides based on the closeness to the computer hardware.</p>
        <p><b>Javascript</b> &rarr; <b>C++</b> &rarr; <b>Assembly Language</b> &rarr; <b>Machine Code</b> </p>
        <p>JavaScript is more high level than C++ and C++ is more than the Assembly language. Closer the language to the machine better is its performance 
          and less is its compilation complexity. </p>
        <p>Chrome V8 engine is really fast because it is written in C++. It also manages the memory allocation for the JavaScript programs. Allocating and 
          deallocating memory to the objects as well as managing the threads stack memory is the responsibility of the V8 engine. </p>
        <p>Now we know the role Chrome V8 engine plays in Node.js for making JavaScript reall fast and performant.</p>
